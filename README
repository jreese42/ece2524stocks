Current state of the game:
Run game.py
10 stocks are listed in the following format
	[Num]) [Stock], [Number Owned], [Price], [Change]
To use the game, type one of the following:
	 buy [how many] [stock number]
	sell [how many] [stock number]
	done
The 'done' command will finish the day's trading and simulate a new day.

Known Issues:
	There is no limit on player spending.  You can buy as many of any stock as you want, regardless of cash on hand.
	This also means you can sell more stocks than you have to end up with negative stocks
	Stock changes tend to trend negative in the first few days despite randomness
	There are currently no game objectives
